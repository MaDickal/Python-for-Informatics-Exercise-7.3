Exercise 7.3

Sometimes when programmers get bored or want to have a bit of fun,
they add a harmless Easter Egg to their program (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Easter_egg_(media)). Modify the program that prompts the user for the file
name so that it prints a funny message when the user types in the exact file name
’na na boo boo’. The program should behave normally for all other files which
exist and don’t exist.
